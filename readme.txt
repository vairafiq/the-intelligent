Automate WooCommerce up-sells/cross-sales to increase your sales with the help of Machine Learning Artificial Intelligence.

== Description ==

Sales boost up to 40% without almost no effort!😲

Yes! Amazon has applied this strategy which returns 35% more sales. Let's compare with an electronics shop, a number of your customers are used to buy Laptop, bag and wireless keyboard together. When new customers add Laptops to their basket, The Intelligent suggests them to purchase bag and a wireless keyboard as well.

When a customer selects a product and redirects to the shopping cart or checkout page, a list of recommendations can be placed at some flexible positions which offer the customer the ability to add additional products to the shopping cart based on their current cart product. 

== Scale to Millions of Products ==

Many other plugins offer this where you need to decide which products should be linked with whom manually. That is fine for a small shop with 10-100 products but it is pretty impossible to manage thousands of products and categories 🤯. The Intelligent is designed to manage an automated recommendation by using a Machine Learning Artificial Intelligence 😎.

The AI library analyses all sales of your store behind the scene and processes them to update the AI. So, there will be no performance issue for the analysis.

== How it works with WooCommerce shop ==

The machine-learning artificial intelligence analyses all the sales in a smart way, it learns from them, and then it is able to predict the most relevant products to your customers, thus increasing sales. 

With each purchase going forward, it keeps learning and gets better and better.

The more data it has to learn from, the better it gets at suggesting products. The predictions are saved in the database and are reused in a lightweight way. 

On activation it will analyze all previous orders, then each month it will update the suggestions. We decided to go for monthly retraining in order to keep the suggestions fresh and relevant, such as seasonal items or general user preferences.

You can show the final recommendation in:

👉 After cart table or confirmation button
👉 After checkout form
👉 Anywhere by using WooCommerce products shortcode
👉 Related products in a single product
